# Introduction to **Gomoku AI**

Welcome to the documentation for the Gomoku AI project.

This project aims to implement a powerful AI agent capable of playing the game of Gomoku (also known as Five in a Row) at a competitive level. The AI adheres to the Pbrain protocol, making it compatible with various Gomoku interfaces and tournament platforms.

---

## Project Overview

The Gomoku AI is built with performance and strategy in mind using C++.

### Key Features

- **Minimax Algorithm**: Utilizes the minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to efficiently search the game tree.
- **Heuristic Evaluation**: Implements sophisticated evaluation functions to assess board states and prioritize moves.
- **Pbrain Protocol**: Fully compliant with the Pbrain protocol for seamless integration.
- **Optimized Performance**: C++ implementation ensures rapid decision-making within time limits.
